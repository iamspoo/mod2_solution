Web design is the most common term for professionals in this industry. Oftentimes, when people say they are a "web designer," 
they refer to a very broad set of skillsâ€”one of which is visual design.
<br>
The "design" part of this equation deals with the customer-facing or front-end part of the website. 
A web designer is concerned with how a site looks and how the customers interact with it.
Good web designers use the principles of design to create a site that looks great. 
They also understand web usability and how to create sites that are user-friendly.

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
<br>static : Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow 	
<br>absolute : The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element 	
<br>fixed : The element is positioned relative to the browser window 	
<br>relative : The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position
